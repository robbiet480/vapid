The claims file should be a JSON formatted file that holds the
information that describes you. There are three elements in the claims
file you'll need:

    "sub" This is your site's admin email address
          (e.g. "mailto:admin@example.com")
    "exp" This is the expiration time for the claim in seconds. If you don't
          have one, I'll add one that expires in 24 hours.

You're also welcome to add additional fields to the claims which could be
helpful for the Push Service operations team to pass along to your operations
team (e.g. "ami-id": "e-123456", "cust-id": "a3sfa10987"). Remember to keep
these values short to prevent some servers from rejecting the transaction due
to overly large headers. See https://jwt.io/introduction/ for details.

For example, a claims.json file could contain:

{"sub": "mailto:admin@example.com"}
